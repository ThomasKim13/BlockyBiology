As for this project the pseudo code would look something like this in JavaScript

var DNA1, DNA2, numMutations, Count;


DNA1 = 'ATCGATCGATCG';
DNA2 = 'ATCGATGGATCG';
numMutations = 0;
for (var count = 0; count < DNA1; count++) {
  if (DNA1.charAt((Count - 1)) == Count.charAt((Count - 1))) {
    window.alert('Hello World');
  } else {
    window.alert('Hello World');
  }
}

This JavaScript code was produced by Blocky when creating Blocky code. 

As for now this is just a prototype of how the code would look like in Blocky when the Blocky code is all written out. 
For now the code doesn't seem to work on Blocky because it runs into errors comparing strings. 

For now this is done using for loops. However, future interactions there will be an implementation of recursion because any for loop can be simply turned into a recursive function. 
However, for now it is simpler to use a for loop to compare and get our idea on Blocky and figure out how Block works in a simplistic manner. 

Realistically, the data that we would need for our project would be basic Biology knowledge such as Sickle Cell Anaemia where the DNA that is produced is not GAG(CTC) but rather GTG(CAC) which produces the protein VAL instead of GLU.
The data can be stored in a list of diseases that are caused by mutations.
